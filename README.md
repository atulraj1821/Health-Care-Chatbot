# Health-Care-Chatbot
The project aims to establish a system-human interface that can answer simple enquiries about health-related factors before going to a doctor.
LSTM algorithm under NLP is employed in order to train and test the dataset to maximum accuracy for the chatbot to give response.
The backend of the Project is built on Flask which is a very efficient Python Library.
To provide the user interface of the chatbot system, we have used HTML, CSS, JAVA- SCRIPT to build a website like page.
